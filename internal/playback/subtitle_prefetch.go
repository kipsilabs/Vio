// subtitlePrefetchMaxWindows bounds the work one prefetch kick may do. A
// prefetch exists to cover the viewer's next page or two; anything wider is
// the full-track warm's job (or the client's own window requests).
const subtitlePrefetchMaxWindows = 2

// PrefetchWindowsInBackground fills the bounded window cache for the windows a
// mid-file playhead is about to need, using the ordinary windowed extract path.
//
// It is the safe alternative to starting a full-track warm mid-file. A
// full-track warm always extracts from source zero and commits under the
// whole-track artifact key; starting one at a playhead would publish a tail
// slice as the complete track, with offsets that do not match the source
// timeline and without the cues before the seek. A bounded prefetch never
// commits an artifact: each window goes through ServeExtractWithResult, which
// stores the slice under windowResultKey (or its covering-window family) and
// lets fix 2's covering lookup serve the next request without another extract.
//
// The prefetch is deliberately opportunistic, like every other detached warm:
//
//   - It skips while the request path is saturated for the source — every slot
//     held, or a client read shed inside the quiet window — so it never adds a
//     demux to a relay pipe that is already refusing client reads. The check
//     runs before the kick and before every window, so capacity that fills
//     after the kick still stops the remaining windows.
//
//   - It draws from the detached admission budget and shares warmSem with the
//     full-track warms, so a burst of kicks and an idle warm cannot stack
//     background demuxes server-wide. No capacity means the kick is dropped; the
//     next window miss re-attempts it.
//
//   - At most subtitlePrefetchMaxWindows windows run per kick, and identical
//     concurrent windows coalesce through the cache's window flight.
//
// windows beyond the cap are ignored. The returned channel closes exactly once
// when the prefetch settles or is skipped.
