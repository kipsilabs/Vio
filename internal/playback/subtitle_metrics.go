// Subtitle serve-path metrics (measurement only).
//
// A subtitle response can be produced by four materially different paths with
// very different costs: a committed full-track artifact (a disk read), the
// in-memory last-good window (a copy), an in-progress ASS warm's retained
// prefix (a render), and a source extract (an ffmpeg demux, possibly of a slow
// relay). These counters are incremented at the exact return points of the
// existing paths and change nothing about which path a request takes. They
// exist so the multi-second subtitle cost can be attributed per class before
// any behavior changes; the admission and probe counters attribute the
// remaining time to contention and validation.
//
// Every counter here is a pure observation: no request reads one back, no
// response shape depends on one, and no scheduling decision uses one.
