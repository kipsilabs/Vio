// Paging a remote bitmap track: what a page may cost before it is worth
// extracting at all.
//
// A bounded bitmap page is answered by reading the container from byte zero and
// discarding everything before the window, because a relay input has no seek the
// demuxer can trust. A page therefore pays for its whole prefix, not just its own
// span, and the prefix is the part that hurts: a page at 3600 s of an 18 GB
// release read gigabytes of container in 88 s in production while its read count
// stayed under the runtime cap, since the relay answered the seek with range
// reads. A byte counter alone cannot tell that page from a cheap one.
//
// The gate below is the pre-extract estimate. It refuses a page when the prefix
// it would have to read is beyond the budget, in bytes or in time at the rate
// this identity's extracts have been observed to read. A refusal is the
// retryable 503 the client already backs off from, advertises the progressive
// artifact's coverage in X-Subtitle-Coverage, and is what starts that artifact's
// fill (the API handler owns the fill because its relay registration outlives
// the request).
//
// An opening page is never refused: its prefix is zero, so it extracts exactly as
// before. The page itself is what the viewer asked for; only the discarded prefix
// is bounded.
