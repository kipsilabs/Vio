// Progressive bitmap subtitles: one unbounded .sup extract per source, track and
// format generation, served behind a coverage watermark.
//
// A windowed PGS extract cannot seek a non-seekable relay, so ffmpeg demuxes the
// container from byte 0 and discards the prefix: the cost of a page at offset S
// is (S + W) × bitrate, not W × bitrate. A 120 s page of an 18.25 GB / 35 Mbps
// source is ~525 MB, which is also subtitleWindowExtractTimeout, so such pages
// died at the timeout and returned a partial .sup with no complete display set.
//
// The fix is to demux the track once, unbounded, and serve pages from what that
// extract has already written. The extract is the cache's ordinary full-track
// fill (one per key, single-flighted, in a warm slot drawing the detached relay
// budget); this file only adds what a page needs on top of it:
//
//   - supCoverage parses the artifact as it grows and records how far the
//     display sets it holds reach (coveredUntilSeconds), so a page can be
//     answered without reading the source;
//   - the fill serves a covered page by copying the display sets that show in
//     the window out of its own artifact file;
//   - a page beyond the watermark is retryable, advertising the covered range,
//     and the miss kicks the fill.
//
// The watermark never overstates. It advances only at a complete display set
// (PCS … END) that has been read in full, so a page ahead of it is never
// answered from a truncated run, and a fill that ends early publishes nothing.
